Color-based solution -> search for green pixel groups

Description:
This simple algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the vegetation is usually green colored. (grass, leafs, etc.)

1. Import RGB image.
Pre-processing:
2. Dilate all non gray scale pixel's green channel. (Each color channels' intensity must not be 'similar'.)
   This step's goal is to make the detection easier of those pixels which may are a part of the vegetation regions.
Main method:
3. Mark all green pixels. A pixel is considered to be green if the green channel's intensity is greater with at least 10 units than red and blue channel's one.
Post-processing:
4. Run median filter on the output binary image to decrease the salt-pepper noise which consists of fake detected or missing vegetation pixels.
5. Morphologically open then close the current output image to separate the vegetation and non vegetation regions.

Advantages/strong side:
Detects precisely the bright green colored vegetation, and clearly skip the gray scale or blue colored objects just like the sky or the road.

Disadvantages/weak points:
Detects other (but not all) green objects as vegetation. It also can not detect the dark or non green vegetation regions just like shadows.
